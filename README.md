## :fire: &nbsp; How to Run &nbsp; :fire:

Open the directory to the file: 'simple-scanner' and run the program by typing: 
`sudo python3 networkScanner.py`


##### Setup Information

During setup for Linux users, the python program _(core.py and networkScanner.py)_ will go into the directory: `/usr/share/simple-scanner`

As for the bash program, that will allow for running the program with the command 'simple-scanner', will go to the directory: `/usr/bin`

This however does not work for Mac OS users as the `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/share` ***is not*** accessable even with sudo.
This is because Macs limit the power of the root account, so that even if you become root, you don't have full control over the system.
